# VoxelTechDemo
This is a small project I'm working on to hone my OpenGL and C++ skills. It is a work-in-progress Minecraft-inspired voxel engine with procedural terrain generation. Currently, I only plan for the scene to be for viewing, but that may change as both the project and I grow.

---

### My plans for this project are to:
1. Abstract Block/Chunk creation    __DONE__
2. Optimize number of draw calls (frustum culling, occlusion culling, greedy meshing (maybe))
3. Manage chunk generation
4. Add biome generation
5. Implement Perlin Worms for cave generation
6. Beautification (lighting, water shader, skybox, etc.)

The nightly branch is being used solely as a backup for my local branch and may not be stable. If you want to view the stable version, make sure to clone the main branch.
